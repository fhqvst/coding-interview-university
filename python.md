# Notes

- A python `set` can only contain immutable values.
- Using try/except instead of if/else lets the program run without spending unnecessary time evaluating checks
- 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... 1/k is defined as the nth harmonic number, and approximates ln k + O(1)

# Questions

- What does it means that lists are implemented as "array-based sequences"? What happens if we store a huuuge element in the array? How does Python know where to place the next element? How does using indices as memory-adress offsets work?
